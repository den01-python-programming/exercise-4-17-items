# Exercise 4.17 Items

Implement the class `Items` described here. **NB!** Don't modify the class `Item`.

Write a program that reads names of items from the user. If the name is empty, the program stops reading. Otherwise, the given name is used to create a new item, which you will then add to the `items` list.

Having read all the names, print all the items by using the `__str__` method of the  `Item` class. The implementation of the `Item` class keeps track of the time of creation, in addition to the name of the item.

An example of the working program is given below:

```plaintext
Name: **Hammer**
Name: **Collar**
Name:

Hammer (created at: 06.07.2018 12:34:56)
Collar (created at: 06.07.2018 12:34:57)
```
