# Exercise 4.17 Items

Implement the class `Item` described here.

Write a program that reads names of items from the user. If the name is empty, the program stops reading. Otherwise, the given name is used to create a new item, which you will then add to the `items` list.

Having read all the names, print all the items by using the `__str__` method of the  `Item` class. The implementation of the `Item` class keeps track of the time of creation, in addition to the name of the item.

An example of the working program is given below:

```plaintext
Name: **Hammer**
Name: **Collar**
Name:

Hammer (created at: 2020-04-28 15:09:17.858559)
Collar (created at: 2020-04-28 15:09:19.038271)
```
